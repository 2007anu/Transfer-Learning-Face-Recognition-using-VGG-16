# Transfer-Learning-Face-Recognition-using-VGG-16
This repository shows how we can use transfer learning in keras with the example of training a face recognition model using VGG-16 pre-trained weights.

Transfer learning refers to the technique of using knowledge of one domain to another domain.i.e. a NN model trained on one dataset can be used for other dataset by fine-tuning the former network.

Definition : Given a source domain Ds and a learning task Ts, a target domain Dt and learning task Tt, transfer learning aims to help improve the learning of the the target predictive function Ft(.) in Dt using the knowledge in Ds and Ts, where Ds ≠ Dt, or Ts ≠ Tt.
